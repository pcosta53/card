## Documentation for Business Card

I attempted to make a digital business card that demonstrates my eye for design while also promoting my talent as an artist. Itâ€™s simple yet exuberant with calming color to sooth the viewer. My goal is to entice you with my skills so you may wish to choose me for any of your needs requiring a designer at hand. My personal branding is sought to be unique and hopefully inspiring to other individuals. This is my first webpage. The designing was easy, but with help from others I was able to create what is now my business card.
