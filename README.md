## Documentation for Business Card

I had originally wanted to use 3D models for my business card, having the card itself and and the graphics being 3D and moving around in a 3D space. While this didn't pan out, I reworked my plans to work in a 2D environment. I used HTML for my text and incorporating my graphics but CSS was the main player for the design of my business card site. I used @keyframes to animate the 5 bubble graphics on my site, making them rotate around a fixed point in order to give off the impression that they were floating, as well as for the particles I have slowly moving on the screen. These two uses of @keyframes in a way helped me achieve the effect I wanted to go with in my original 3D design for my site.
